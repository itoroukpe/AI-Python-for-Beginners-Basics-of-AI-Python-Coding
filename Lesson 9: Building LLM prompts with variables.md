## L9: Building LLM prompts with variables
In the next cell, you will import the function print_llm_response that uses an LLM with an instruction that you provide as a string and displays the result.
```bash
from helper_functions import print_llm_response
```
Basically, you can use that function as if you were asking a chatbot. You just need to provide your instructions as a string. For instance, you can ask "What is the capital of France?" using the following code:
```bash
print_llm_response("What is the capital of France?")
```
Let's ask the LLM for the lifestyle description for Otto Matic, whose name is stored in name, if he were a dog_age years old dog.
```bash
name = "Otto Matic"
dog_age = 21/7
```
---
```bash
print_llm_response(f"""If {name} were a dog, he would be {dog_age} years old.
Describe what life stage that would be for a dog and what that might 
entail in terms of energy level, interests, and behavior.""")
```
You just used AI with your own variables! You used an LLM with instructions that included variables you defined in this notebook.

Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉

### Variable names restrictions
The following variable names also have some problems. Try to fix them yourself or use the help from the chatbot.
```bash
driver = "unicorn"
driver_vehicle = "colorful, asymmetric dinosaur car"
favorite_planet = "Pluto"
```
Now, update the next cell with any changes you made in the previous cell.
```bash
print_llm_response(f"""Write me a 300 word children's story about a {driver} racing
a {driver's vehicle} for the {favorite planet} champion cup.""")
```
### Extra practice
Try the exercises below to practice the concepts from this lesson. Read the comments in each cell with the instructions for each exercise.

Feel free to use the chatbot if you need help.
```bash
# Fix this code
1favorite-book = "1001 Ways to Wear a Hat"
"2002 Ways to Wear a Scarf" = second_fav_book
print(f"My most favorite book is {1favorite-book}, but I also like {second_fav_book})
```
---
```bash
# Make variables for your favorite game, movie, and food.
# Then use print_llm_response to ask the LLM to recommend you
# a new song to listen to based on your likes.
​
print_llm_response(f"""
​
""")
```
